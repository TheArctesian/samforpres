	<h2>Demand for Student Housing: An Overview</h2>
	<div>
		<p>
			Every year, more than 45,000 students enroll at UC Berkeley, which creates a huge demand for
			rental properties near campus. There is still a large discrepancy between supply and demand
			for university-owned student housing, despite efforts to expand it. Campus data indicates that
			the housing system usually receives many more applications than it can handle, which drives up
			the cost of rent for living off campus.
		</p>
		<p>
			On-campus housing: According to the most recent information provided by the university, UC
			Berkeley has over 20 residence halls and apartment complexes, yet only 9,875 beds are
			available for its 45,000 students. Most UCB students are unable to locate housing on campus
			due to space and price restrictions, therefore many choose to either look into higher-cost
			options or find housing through the Berkeley Student Cooperative system (BSC).
		</p>
		<p>
			With a large percentage of students suffering homelessness and housing instability, the
			problem of student homelessness is a critical one at UC Berkeley. In UC Berkeley's 2017
			housing survey, almost 10% of students said they had been homeless at some point during their
			academic careers, and over 20% of postdocs agreed with the assertion. It appears that
			combating student homelessness and helping at-risk students who are having difficulty finding
			permanent housing are critical priorities.

	<h2>Policy Recommendations:</h2>
	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
	<p>
		We propose a two-pronged policy approach to start addressing the concerns of students in terms
		of finding affordable accommodation. First, a BSC Housing Oversight Committee will be
		established in order to address the requirements of the students residing in the BSC. The
		creation of a Student accommodation Support Program is the second step toward meeting the
		requirements of students who are looking for off-campus accommodation outside of the BSC.
	</p>
	<h3>Berkeley Student Co-operative (BSC):</h3>
	<p>
		Established in 1933, the BSC operates over 20 cooperative houses and apartment complexes (often
		referred to as Co-Ops), collectively housing hundreds of students each year. Co-Ops offer unique
		and affordable housing for students. Students in the Co-Ops perform weekly chores and
		participate in regular democratic meetings to maintain the cleanliness of their house.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to having to work off some of their rent, students face other trade-offs in exchange
		for the lower rent prices the Co-Ops offer. For example, the high turnover rate in Co-Op rooms
		allows for sanitary or plumbing issues to often go unnoticed. Maintenance and privacy issues in
		Co-Op housing often cause mental strain for student inhabitants who can’t afford to find housing
		elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>1. Case Study - Barrington Hall</p>
	<div>
		<p>
			The closure of Barrington Hall in 1990 serves as a cautionary tale highlighting the challenges
			faced by Co-Op buildings. As recently reflected in an article by the SF Chronicle, the current
			state of Berkeley’s Co-Ops has been declining and appears similar to Barrington Hall in the
			late 80s; to prevent similar closures in the future, the ASUC Office of the President will
			propose instantiation of an oversight committee to extend financial and organizational support
			to the BSC.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>2. Policy Proposal: BSC Housing Oversight Committee</p>

	<div>
		<p>
			We propose that the ASUC invests significant funding in a BSC oversight committee, where
			nearly all funds would go directly to BSC Co-ops and students within these co-ops. This
			committee would be able to offer emergency relief funding to students within the co-ops and
			relief to co-ops with maintenance issues.
		</p>
	</div>
	<p>
		While the BSC is vital in providing housing to a large number of students, there do exist
		problems inherent to the system that have yet to be addressed by internal solutions. The BSC
		prides itself on isolation from external pressures and responds to the needs of their residents
		internally. Nevertheless, there exists tangible evidence of negligence and poor living
		conditions within co-ops. While it is unclear where this failure of living standards originates
		due to a lack of data and isolation, this must be addressed. Firstly, a comprehensive review of
		the co-op system is necessary in order to ascertain the root causes of these issues.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to accomplish further investigation, we recommend the creation of a BSC Housing
		Oversight Committee.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the powers of the committee would be systematically limited in scope and ability, the
		primary goal is student health monitoring. This would require the creation of basic standards of
		living in BSC housing complexes. These standards are rooted within the Berkeley 19.40 Municipal
		Housing Code. While BSC is still subject to these regulations, this formed oversight committee
		would provide a first-look, allowing co-ops to meet compliance before they would be fined before
		the city, and additionally receive financial support from the ASUC.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once an in-depth analysis of the housing standards of BSC properties is completed, the oversight
		council will have emergency funds to address outstanding livability concerns. We propose the
		oversight committee establishes a list of vetted contractors, who the board can fund to complete
		necessary repairs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, current student issues regarding livability standards are reported to student house
		managers. While internal elections and co-op leaders are a vital cultural and structural element
		of the Berkeley BSC system, an oversight board is vitally necessary in ensuring the safety
		standards for students. Additionally, this reduces the strain on housing managers, who currently
		have to manage the living conditions of dozens of students, while being a student themselves. A
		creation of the oversight board will ensure student residents receive a reputable and powerful
		system to address emergency housing needs.
	</p>

	<h2>Student Housing Instability:</h2>
	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
	<p>
		The issue of student homelessness is a pressing concern at UC Berkeley, with a significant
		number of students experiencing housing insecurity and homelessness. The ASUC Office of the
		President proposes a comprehensive policy initiative to address student homelessness by
		leveraging data from the 2017 housing survey to understand the scope of the problem and
		implement effective solutions.
	</p>

	<h3>Problem Overview:</h3>
	<p>
		According to the 2017 housing survey conducted at UC Berkeley, nearly <b
			>10% of students reported experiencing homelessness at one point in their academic career,
			with more than 20% of postdocs agreeing to the statement.
		</b>This data underscores the urgent need to address student homelessness and provide support to
		vulnerable students who are struggling to secure stable housing.
	</p>

	<h3>Student Housing Support Program</h3>
	<p>Establish a Student Housing Support Program:</p>
	<div>
		<p>
			1. Create a dedicated Student Housing Support Program aimed at assisting homeless and
			housing-insecure students at UC Berkeley.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Provide financial assistance, housing vouchers, and emergency housing options to students
			facing homelessness or housing instability.
		</p>
		<p>
			3. Offer case management services, counseling, and referrals to community resources to help
			students navigate housing challenges and access essential support services.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Expand Affordable Housing Options:</h3>

	<div>
		<p>
			1. Increase the availability of affordable housing options for UC Berkeley students by
			collaborating with local housing providers, developers, and government agencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Advocate for the development of new student housing projects, including affordable
			dormitories, cooperative housing communities, and off-campus apartments, to meet the growing
			demand for affordable housing.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Enhance Housing Assistance Programs:</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			1. Strengthen existing housing assistance programs, such as rental assistance grants, housing
			subsidies, and roommate matching services, to support students in securing affordable housing
			arrangements.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Streamline application processes, increase outreach efforts, and expand eligibility
			criteria to ensure that students in need can access housing assistance programs effectively.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Provide Comprehensive Support Services:</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			1. Establish on-campus support centers or resource hubs where homeless and housing-insecure
			students can access a wide range of services, including food assistance, financial literacy
			workshops, legal aid, and mental health counseling.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Offer emergency housing relief to students, by directly funding their housing while they
			find long-term housing.
		</p>
		<p>
			3. Partner with community organizations, nonprofit agencies, and local businesses to expand
			the availability of support services and resources for students experiencing homelessness.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Implementation and Evaluation:</h2>

	<p>
		The ASUC Office of the President will engage in partnerships with university stakeholders,
		student-run groups, and local community organizations to enact the suggested policy measures.
		Regular monitoring and evaluation of the program's effectiveness will be conducted using
		quantitative data from housing surveys, student feedback, and outcome metrics related to housing
		stability and student well-being. Adjustments and improvements will be made based on the
		findings to ensure the continued success of the program in addressing student homelessness at UC
		Berkeley.
