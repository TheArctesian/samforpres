	<h1 class="text-center">Student Health</h1>

	<p class="">
		Student health and wellbeing is paramount to the success, happiness, and wellbeing of our
		students. We’ve identified substantial problems in our mental health services, and our
		universities current work on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harrasement (SVSH). We propose extensive
		policy proposals to address both of these issues.
	</p>

	<h2>Mental Health:</h2>

	<p>
		Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at UC Berkeley has a mission to provide
		comprehensive support for students' emotional, psychological, educational, social, and cultural
		development. Despite this mission, there have been notable shortcomings in accessibility and
		effectiveness. Historically, CAPS offered walk-in services for career counseling, but this has
		transitioned to scheduled appointments, causing inconvenience for students. The Career
		Counseling Library, once readily accessible, now operates virtually with limited availability.
		Individual meetings, crucial for personalized support, require 24-hour advance scheduling,
		hindering immediate assistance. Furthermore, drop-in consultations, though labeled as such,
		necessitate appointments made within the week, constraining timely access. With a meager count
		of 26 counselors for a vast student population, long waiting periods for counseling are
		commonplace. Additionally, the availability of therapy sessions, both virtual and in-person,
		remains limited, leaving students with constrained options and long wait times. Group
		counseling, while offered, demands significant effort from students to secure participation,
		with no guarantee of acceptance. The process for couples counseling is similarly burdensome,
		with ambiguous timelines for response and scheduling. Despite efforts to provide support through
		various channels, CAPS' inefficiencies in accessibility and responsiveness have resulted in
		significant challenges for students seeking mental health services.
	</p>

	<p>
		For students seeking long-term therapy, CAPS offers resources such as the referral database,
		containing names of clinicians interested in working with UC Berkeley students. This database
		allows students to search for providers based on their insurance plan. Additionally, SHIP
		members have access to Teladoc, enabling video visits with licensed therapists or psychologists
		from anywhere. Students with SHIP insurance can also utilize Wellfleet Member Services or the
		Blue Shield of California PPO network to locate in-network providers. UHS Counselors assist
		students in finding off-campus providers compatible with their healthcare plan. Those with other
		insurance plans can use their provider's resources to locate counseling services and utilize the
		CAPS referral database as needed. Despite these resources, challenges in accessing affordable
		and appropriate long-term therapy persist for students at UC Berkeley. In addition, it's
		important to note the financial challenges faced by mental health providers in collaborating
		with SHIP and its partners. According to Weksler, UC Berkeley's current and past student medical
		insurance partners, including Anthem and Aetna, have only reimbursed providers around 50 percent
		of their regular full fee. With the transition to Blue Shield, providers anticipate even lower
		reimbursement rates, making it financially unfeasible for many to offer more than one or two
		therapy slots per week for students, especially considering the high cost of living in the area.
		This financial strain further exacerbates the existing difficulties in accessing timely and
		affordable mental health care for UC Berkeley students.
	</p>

	<p>There is so much that can be done. All we need is your support.</p>

	<h3>Overview of CAPS:</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			The mission of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is to support the emotional,
			psychological, educational, social and cultural development of all UC Berkeley students
			through a wide range of multiculturally based counseling, psychiatric, career consultation,
			training and educational services. (Mission Statement)
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, using data from a recent publication, when students are faced with the question:
			“Within the last 6 months, do you feel like any kinds of things have been traumatic or very
			difficult to handle?” the three most popular types of difficulty reported are “Academics”
			(76.9%), “Career-related Issue” (50.7%), and “Intimate relationship” (36.7%).

However, the library has moved to the third floor of Tang Center and offers virtual programs</li>
	 	<li> Students can also set up individual meetings that have to be scheduled <u>24 hours in advance.</u> During these meetings, students take the Meyers-Briggs personality test and the Strong Interest Inventory test. The results are then presented to a counselor who evaluates </li>

<h2>Sexual Safety: </h2>
<h3>Context: </h3>
<p>In recent years, there has been a problematic increase in sexual violence and sexual harassment on the UC Berkeley campus- a problem which has largely gone unaddressed by ASUC and admin at large. </p>
<p>Stories about sexual assault cases going
	into the bureaucratic void are only increasing, and it is clear that there is a distinct lack of transparency
	that inflicts unneeded stress on already overwhelmed victims. In addition, victims deal with the same
	problems with counseling: meetings at most every 2 weeks, when their needs need to be addressed not
	only fast but consistently.  </p>
<p>
	The UCPD website says the increase in sexual violence reports is likely
	inflation due to the return to in person instruction, and in addition that the increase “reflects individuals
	feeling more confident in reporting incidents of SVSH, not necessarily an increase in SVSH incidents
	occurring”. This is dismissive of the problem at large. </p>
	
	<p>And regardless of the truth of this statement,
	597 SVSH reports were filed in 2022-23 at just the Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination,
	which is an increase from 471 in 2021-22, 272 in 2020-21, and 446 in 2017-18. Change needs to be made,
	but as of late there is nothing being done. Looking at even the most recent historical actions done
	in the past, it is immediately striking that not a single historical- and thus substantive- change
	has been done since 2017 (https://svsh.berkeley.edu/historical-campus-actions). The last facebook post
	from the ASUC Sexual Violence Commission was in 2021. </p>
	
	<p>So nothing has been done yet the number rises.</p>
<h3>	Issues Present: </h3>
	<li>Lack of legislation </li>
	<li>Lack of accountability </li>
	<li>Lack of transparency and swiftness in dealing with cases </li>
	<li>Lack of awareness</li>
	<li>Not enough student organizations </li>
<h3>	Objectives: </h3>
	<li> Improve consent awareness at parties </li>
	<li> Improve accessibility to CAPS and student services for sexual assault victims</li>
	<li> Streamline the SVSH reporting system </li>
<h3>Policy Proposals: </h3>
	<li>Expand on greek life consent talk legislation by modifying the main consent talk template and have resources be advertised at parties based on research done through the Seed Grant Project. Currently only 57% of surveyed students feel that the current consent talk is effective, whereas 81% of students found a modified consent talk effective. We propose the ASUC mandates this new, revised consent talk be used at all Greek life and co-op parties.</li>
	<li>Stricter penalty for individuals (be subject to ASUC created review boards that work through Panhellenic Council and Interfraternity Council instead of only greek life boards) </li>
	<li>Better and more immediate counseling through CAPS (same as our mental health policy), and increasing priority for sexual assault victims. </li>
	<li>Increase community support by creating more grant programs for prevention research </li>
	<li>Increase funding for sexual safety oriented organizations, and incentivize the creation of more</li>
